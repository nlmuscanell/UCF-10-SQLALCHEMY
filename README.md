# SQLAlchemy - Surfs Up!

SQLAlchemy, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), and Flask were used to analyze and present findings from a database on the climate in Hawaii.  

## Climate Analyses

Python and SQLAlchemy were used to examine precipation levels at various weather stations in Hawaii. Queries were performed to examine the most active weather stations, in addition to the conditions during specific date ranges. The main findings were added to a DataFrame and plotted via barplots and stacked area plots. The analysis focused on rainfall at the weather stations (min, max, and average), in addition to temperatures.

## Climate App

Flask and SQLAlchemy were used to then create an API based on SQLAlchemy queries. The API consists of five routes, including the home page.
